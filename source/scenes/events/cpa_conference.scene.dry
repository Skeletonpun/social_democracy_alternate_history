= CPA Party Conference

Now is the KPD's national party conference, where they will choose their new leadership. The shadow of the Wittorf Affair hangs over it. On one hand are the hardline supporters of Thälmann, who support a "social fascist" policy that places the SPD as equivalent to the Nazis. On the other hand is the "Conciliator" faction, who support a more cooperative policy towards the SPD.

After our discussion with the Soviets, we are inclined to believe that Stalin is at least open to the Conciliators. In order to affect the KPD's leadership elections, we have to influence both the Comintern leaders as as well as the KPD membership.

With our support, the Conciliators have won the leadership contest! The new leadership is a group of Conciliators, including Arthur Ewert, Hugo Eberlein, and Ernst Meyer. Thälmann remains, but largely as a figurehead only, it seems. We hope that the new leadership will be more inclined towards cooperation.

Unfortunately, we could not influence the KPD leadership election against the hardliners. Thälmann quickly moves to consolidate absolute leadership, expelling or exiling his opponents.
